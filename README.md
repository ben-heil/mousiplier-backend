# adage-backend

This repository hosts Python 3.X backend of the web server
[adage.greenelab.com](https://adage.greenelab.com). Some of the code was ported
from the [old-adage-server](https://github.com/greenelab/old-adage-server) repository, 
which was written in Python 2.X and has been deprecated since May, 2020.

The latest frontend code is hosted in
[adage-frontend](https://github.com/greenelab/adage-frontend) 
repository.
